      <p class="para1">My name is Tadiwa <span>Mkwenje</span>, but I would prefer it if people called me by my surname, why? Because I think people will find it easier to pronounce.
                        A little bit more about me, I was born in Zimbabwe and my family emigrated to Ireland when I was seven years old,
                          so I have pretty much have been in Ireland all my life, however I still can't speak a lick of IRISH.
                            I hope to have an enjoyable couple of years here at NCI and a prosperous journey here.</p>
